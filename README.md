## Project Description

BLX app intends to mimic an ecommerce platorm where users can register to buy products from other users, but also can register their own products to be sold.

I used FastAPI package to develop the API Rest pattern, alongside with SQLAlchemy to manage the relatioship and connection with a local Postgress database and the API requests.
    

## What I have learned?

This project has the porpuse to create an real api project with Fast Api that allowed me to understand and put in practice:

- authentication principles with JWT, 
- Develop and Config Database in Postgress SQL,
- Auto generation of migrations in database with Alembic,
- Log in and Signup methods, 
- CRUD methods with HTTPs requests,
- Set up Automatic API Documentation with Swagger
